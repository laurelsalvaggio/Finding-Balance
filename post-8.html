    <h1>💔 My Ex (Who I Never Even Met) Says He Still Loves Me — And Honestly, It’s So Weird</h1>

  <p>There’s nothing more unhinged than an ex you <em>never actually met in person</em> still popping into your life like you’re on season 6 of a very chaotic sitcom. Except this time, it’s not funny — it’s weird. And also a little sad. And also something I bring up to my therapist more than I care to admit.</p>

  <p>Let me explain.</p>

  <p>We were in a long-distance “relationship” (<em>yes, the quotes are doing heavy lifting here</em>) where we were literally on the phone or FaceTime all the time. I fell asleep on the phone with him. We texted constantly. At the time, it felt <strong>real</strong>. Like, capital-R Real. I cared about him. I pictured meeting him, building something. I fully bought into the idea that this could go somewhere.</p>

  <p>And then, like things sometimes do, it all fell apart.</p>

  <p>That’s around the time I met Ryan — my now boyfriend, and hopefully future husband if the universe is listening. Everything that felt confusing and unstable before suddenly made sense. I realized how much I had settled for a connection that was more imagination than reality.</p>

  <p>My breakup with long-distance-ex-not-technically-a-boyfriend was messy. Emotional. It still makes me feel yucky inside, like a hangover I never fully recovered from. And yeah — it’s something I still talk about in therapy, because that kind of emotional whiplash doesn’t just disappear.</p>

  <p>But here’s the kicker: <strong>he still reaches out.</strong> Every couple months, it’s a new message. “I still love you.” “I miss what we had.”</p>

  <blockquote>Sir, <strong>we had phone calls.</strong> You didn’t even know my height. You’ve never met Ryan — and that man takes the trash out without me asking. There is no competition.</blockquote>

  <p>It's not even that I’m angry. It's more like… confused. Like a ghost who keeps texting me. Like Ross Geller screaming “We were on a break!” 10 years after the break.</p>

  <p>I’m not bitter. I just don’t want to live in that delusion anymore. I have a life now. A real one. With real love, real communication, and someone who shows up — not just virtually.</p>

  <p>So, to anyone stuck in the in-between of a digital relationship that ended but still haunts your DMs: you’re not alone. And it’s okay to feel gross about it. But you deserve better than someone who couldn’t even make the effort to meet you, yet somehow thinks you’re still their soulmate.</p>

  <p><em>To him: This isn’t <strong>You’ve Got Mail</strong>. I’ve got Ryan. And peace. And a therapist who agrees I made the right call.</em></p>
