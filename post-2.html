    <h1>My First Coding Project - Building My Own Website from Scratch</h1>
    
    <h2>Why a Website?</h2>
    <p>I wanted a space that was entirely mine—somewhere I could showcase projects, write about what I was learning, and experiment with new things as I grew. A personal website felt like the perfect starting point. It was practical, creative, and challenging enough to push me out of tutorial mode and into actual development.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>I didn't have a clear plan in the beginning. I just knew I wanted it to look clean and feel like <em>me</em>. I started with the basics:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML</strong> for the structure</li>
        <li><strong>CSS</strong> for the design</li>
        <li><strong>A touch of JavaScript</strong> to make it interactive</li>
      </ul>
      I still remember writing my first <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and styling it with some very questionable colors. But hey, it was mine—and it worked.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges and Small Wins</h2>
    <p>There were plenty of frustrating moments. Layouts did't align, images didn't size properly, and don't get me started on trying to center a div. I Googled everything. I read Stack Overflow threads like they were survival guides. But every time I figured something out—no matter how small—I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment.</p>

    <p>One big milestone was setting up responsive design. Seeing my website adjust smoothly on both a phone and desktop made me feel like I'd unlocked a superpower.</p>

    <h2>What I Built</h2>
    <p>The site started simple: a homepage, an about section, and a projects page. I added links, embedded images, and even experimented with subtle animations. As it came together, I saw not just a site—but my progress—on the screen.</p>

    <p>It wasn't perfect, but it was functional, and more importantly, it reflected <em>me</em>.</p>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>Building my own website taught me more than just code. I learned how to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Break down problems and think logically</li>
      <li>Research and adapt when things didn't go as planned</li>
      <li>Appreciate small progress over perfection</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It was a reminder that learning to code isn't about knowing everything upfront—it’s about staying curious and persistent.</p>

    <h2>What's Next</h2>
    <p>This project was just the beginning. I'm already thinking about new features to add, maybe a blog section (like this one!), a contact form, or even integrating a CMS down the road.</p>

    <p><strong>If you've been thinking about starting your first coding project, let this be your sign: just start.</strong> You'll learn more than you expect—and you'll be proud you did.</p>
