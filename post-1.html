    <h1>Feelings, Freakouts & Finally Blogging</h1>
    <p class="date">May 24, 2025</p>

    <p>Well... here we are.</p>

    <p>After years of saying “I should start a blog” (and then doing nothing), I've finally taken the plunge. I'm not sure if this is bravery, boredom, or a quarter-life identity crisis—but hey, at least it's productive.</p>

    <p>This is my attempt at opening up to the world. Gently. Cautiously. Like a cat sniffing a new piece of furniture.</p>

    <p>Honestly? I feel like I'm writing in a public diary and someone might actually read it. Which is equal parts thrilling and terrifying. Kind of like yelling “I have feelings!” into a canyon and hoping no one throws them back.</p>

    <p>I also just started learning how to code, which is equal parts empowering and humbling. So far I've only cried twice. Which I'm counting as a win.</p>

    <p>I was recently diagnosed with PCOS, and I'm also working through some mental health stuff. It's... a lot. So this blog will be part journal, part processing space, part hopeful connection point for anyone else out there just trying to figure it out too.</p>

    <p>Thanks for reading. For real. 💗</p>
