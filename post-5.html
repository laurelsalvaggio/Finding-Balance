  <h1>💕 Romanticizing My Life: A Beginner’s Guide</h1>
  <p class="quote">Because turning your Tuesday into a movie montage is totally valid — and yes, this is my Central Perk era.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>✨ Step 1: Pretend You’re the Main Character</h2>
    <p>Think less “damsel in distress,” more <strong>Rachel Green in Season 6</strong>, walking into Ralph Lauren with a latte and self-worth. Whether you’re heading to Target or just reorganizing your skincare shelf, cue your mental soundtrack and give yourself a slow-mo moment.</p>
    <p class="quote">“It’s not that common, it doesn’t happen to every girl, and it <em>is</em> a big deal.” — also me hyping myself up to check my to-do list.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>📖 Step 2: Make Mundane Moments Magical</h2>
    <p><strong>Monica</strong> would absolutely light a candle before scrubbing the baseboards, and you should too. Pour your matcha into a cute glass. Wear perfume even if no one’s around. Put your laundry in mesh bags like it’s high fashion. <strong>Joey</strong> doesn’t share food, but he sure as hell <em>enjoys</em> it — do the same.</p>
    <p class="quote">Life’s too short not to romanticize your 3PM snack like it's a Michelin experience.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🌸 Step 3: Romanticize Rest Too</h2>
    <p>Channel <strong>Chandler’s sarcasm</strong> and take <em>rest</em> very seriously. A bubble bath with a face mask? That's not indulgent. That's <em>preventative emotional maintenance</em>. Lay back. Stare at the ceiling. Practice saying “Could I <strong>BE</strong> any more relaxed?” out loud.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🎀 Step 4: Create Tiny Traditions</h2>
    <p>Start a weekly solo coffee date. Light a candle every time you journal. Watch your comfort show (<em>hint: Friends</em>) while eating comfort food. Build little rituals that feel like home — even if your home is just your room and a playlist called “Soft Girl September.”</p>
    <p class="quote">And if your “tradition” is crying to Phoebe’s “Smelly Cat” in your robe at 11PM… that’s sacred too.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🕯️ Step 5: Curate Your Energy</h2>
    <p>Hang out with people who make you laugh like <strong>Ross's awkward dinosaur jokes</strong>. Who would help you move a couch and yell “<strong>PIVOT!</strong>” with full commitment. Your vibe deserves to be protected like Monica protects her <em>fancy</em> wedding china.</p>
    <p>Romanticizing your life means choosing joy, intention, and not settling for anything less than Joey-level loyalty.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>💌 Closing Thoughts</h2>
    <p>I’m still learning how to be the main character. Some days I feel like background noise in someone else’s pilot episode. But more and more, I’m starting to feel like <strong>Season 3 Rachel</strong> — figuring it out, building a life, and learning to love myself.</p>
    <p>I’m also working on something I’ve never been very good at: <strong>prioritizing <em>me</em></strong>.<br>
    Not just in a bubble bath-and-face-mask kind of way (though those <em>definitely</em> help), but in the deeper sense — choosing myself, standing up for my needs, and not shrinking to fit into spaces that were never made for me.</p>
    <p>And the best part? <strong>You’re coming with me.</strong><br>
    If you’re reading this, you’re now part of my journey — the soft, sometimes messy, always-growing adventure of turning life into something beautiful, one day at a time.</p>
    <p>So here's to romanticizing life — one walk, one playlist, one glass of wine (in a mug if needed) at a time.</p>
    <p class="quote"><strong>And remember: I’ll be there for me.</strong> 💖<br>And maybe you will be too.</p>
