  <h1>✈️ Traveling Stresses Me Out (And I'm So Serious)</h1>

  <p>Okay, so here’s the thing: I <em>like</em> the idea of traveling. I really do. New places? Cute cafés? Feeling like the mysterious girl walking through cobblestone streets in a trench coat? Yes, please.  
  But the process? The logistics? The <strong>flying</strong>?  
  As Joey Tribbiani once said: <blockquote>“Why God, why?!”</blockquote></p>

  <p><strong>Let’s start with flying.</strong><br>
  I know everyone says it’s safer than driving, but let’s be real. Planes are basically giant metal birds held up by science and vibes. If it wants to fall out of the sky, it just can.  
  And while we’re all sitting there pretending turbulence is no big deal, I’m gripping the armrests like Ross holding on to his second divorce.  
  Meanwhile, the person next to me is asleep. <em>Asleep.</em> How?! Teach me your ways, airplane zen master.</p>

  <p><strong>Then there's packing.</strong><br>
  Packing stresses me out like Monica Geller running late with no list. What if I forget something?? I can’t just <em>wing it.</em> I’m not a Chandler going to Yemen. I need a plan.  
  But instead of planning calmly, I pack everything. Outfits for warm weather, cold weather, casual dinners, surprise rooftop parties?? Who knows!  
  Then my bag is overweight, I’m sweating at the check-in counter, and I haven’t even <em>left yet.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Even once I arrive, I can’t relax.</strong><br>
  Sure, I’m excited to explore, but what if my phone dies and I get lost? What if I end up wandering around like Elaine in that one <em>Seinfeld</em> episode, unable to find anyone I came with, just dramatically muttering “I <em>knew</em> this would happen.”  
  I’d like to be carefree, like Phoebe in a foreign city just vibing with a guitar and weird energy. But no—I’m full-on George Costanza: anxious, overthinking, and probably sweating through my shirt.</p>

  <p><strong>I want to be cool about travel. I want to pack light and “go with the flow.”</strong><br>
  But I’m the person who screenshots every map, saves offline directions, checks the gate number <em>four times</em>, and still doesn’t trust it.  
  And yet—I still go.  
  Because deep down, I love the adventure. I love collecting new little stories, seeing things that make me feel small in the best way.  
  I just wish I could get through it all without internally screaming like Janice walked in the room: <blockquote>“Oh. My. Gawd.”</blockquote></p>
