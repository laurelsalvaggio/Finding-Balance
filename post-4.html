  <h1>💌 A Letter to My 16-Year-Old Self</h1>

  <p>Dear 16-year-old me,</p>

  <p>First of all — take a deep breath. I know everything feels heavy right now, like you're supposed to have it all figured out by next week. <em>Spoiler alert:</em> you won’t. And that’s not a bad thing.</p>

  <p>I wish I could tell you that things get easier, but the truth is, some things get messier before they get better. You're going to face stuff that you never saw coming — things that will shake you up and make you question everything. But here's the wild part: you’ll get through it. Every single time.</p>

  <p>Let’s talk about that boy you think you love — yeah, that one. The one you wrote poems about and imagined your whole future with. Babe... he turns out to be a full-blown psycho. Like, red flag Pinterest board level. But don’t worry — at the prime age of 24, you’ll find someone who actually deserves you. Someone kind, steady, funny, and real. And most importantly: someone who doesn’t make you question your worth.</p>

  <p>And if they’re reading this — hi. Just so you know, I really appreciate you. For your patience, for showing up, for being soft in the ways I never knew I needed. You make the hard parts feel a little less heavy. Thank you.</p>

  <p>There will be days where you feel like the world is moving too fast and you’re just trying to keep up. You'll cry. You'll laugh at 2am over something completely stupid. You’ll fall apart. And then, you’ll rebuild — with more softness, more strength, and more self-awareness than you knew was possible.</p>

  <p>You’re going to be diagnosed with PCOS, and you won’t even know what that is at first. It’ll be scary and frustrating and weirdly validating. You’ll also start facing your mental health head-on, and guess what? That’s not weakness. That’s bravery with a capital B.</p>

  <p>Oh — and you’ll start a blog. (I know, right??) You’ll learn to code. You’ll create a space for yourself when the world doesn’t always make room. You’ll finally start opening up, not because you have all the answers, but because you're learning to love yourself enough to share the questions.</p>

  <p>If I could leave you with one thing, it’s this: You are not behind. You are not broken. You are becoming.</p>

  <p class="signature">And honestly? I’m really proud of you.<br><br>
  Love,<br>
  You (but cooler and with better boundaries) 💛</p>
