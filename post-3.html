     <h1>Forgiving Myself</h1>
    <p>Honestly, I’ve been all over the place with my mental health lately. It’s something I’ve struggled with my whole life. Right now, I take four different medications just to feel somewhat stable—not to be “crazy,” as I’ve sometimes told myself.</p>

    <p>Recently, I’ve been working with a professional, and we’ve been digging into my issues with forgiveness and letting go. She shared a quote with me that really stuck:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>“Forgiveness means giving up all hope for a better past.”</strong></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>At first, I was totally confused. What does that even mean? But after we talked it through, it started to click. True forgiveness isn’t about excusing what happened—it’s about accepting that the past is what it is. It’s letting go of the fantasy that things could have been different. It’s about releasing regret and resentment so you can actually move forward.</p>

    <p>There’s still a lot I need to do to let go of the past—and that includes learning how to forgive myself. That part feels especially hard. I’ve always found it difficult to forgive others, so the idea of extending that same grace to myself feels strange. But my therapist said that’s exactly where I need to start.</p>

    <p>And honestly, she’s right.</p>
